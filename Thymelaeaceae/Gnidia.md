Shrublets, undershrubs, or shrubs, often ericoid. Leaves opposite or alternate. Flowers usually in terminal heads or clusters, sometimes solitary or in short spikes; bracts present or 0. Calyx 4- or 5-lobed; tube cylindric to narrowly campanulate, usually hairy and articulated near base; lobes much shorter than tube, mainly oblong or obovate. Petals 0, same number, twice, or sometimes three times as many as calyx lobes, membranous or fleshy, flat or terete, sometimes hairy or surrounded by hairs, smaller than calyx lobes. Stamens usually twice as many as calyx lobes, in 2 series; upper row in mouth of calyx tube, or rarely 0 or aborted; other row in throat or lower; filaments usually shorter than anthers. Disc 0 or surrounding ovary. Ovary 1-locular, with single ovule; style lateral, included; stigma usually simple, sometimes flattened or 2-lobed, usually penicillate. Fruit dry, enclosed in persistent base of calyx tube. Seeds small. x = 9 (7).
Species ± 140, mainly Africa, few extending to Madagascar and India; ± 97 in sthn Afr., widespread in Namibia, Botswana, Northern Province, North-West, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Swaziland, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Northern, Western and Eastern Cape. Consensus of opinion favours the reduction in the number of genera, mainly because of the variable nature of the differentiating characters.

Shrubs or perennial herbs arising from a woody base or rhizome. Leaves alternate, rarely opposite. Inflorescences consisting of bracteate few-many-flowered heads. Flowers bisexual, 4-5-merous. Calyx-tube cylindric, usually articulated above the ovary, lobes coloured. Petals alternating with the calyx lobes, sometimes 0. Stamens in 2 whorls in the throat of the calyx tube. Fruit dry, small.

####Gnidia aberrans
A much-branched shrub; branches stout, at first pilose, soon glabrous, leaf-scars conspicuous but not very prominent; leaves alternate, approximate, ovat-lanceolate, acute, 3 lin. long, 1 lin. wide, with a few short scattered hairs above, densely silky and slightly verrucose beneath; flowers few near the apex of the branches; calyx densely silky outside, yellow (*Wylie*); ovoid base of tube 1 lin. long, narrowly funnel-shaped part 3 lin. long; lobes oblong, subacute, 1.25 lin. long, 0.75 lin. wide; petals 4, fleshy, anther-like, ovate-lanceolate, 0.75 lin. long; staminodes 0; anthers 4, distinctly included, oblong, obtuse; ovary compressed, 0.5 lin. long; style about half as long as the calyx-tube; stigma shortly penicellate.
EASTERN REGION: Natal; Giant's Castly, 8000-10000 ft., *Wylie in Herb. Wood.* 10611.
This is an extremely anomalous plant as regards its floral structure. It differs from all the South African species of *Gnidia*, except *G. harveyana*, Meisn., and *G. anomala*, Meisn., in having only 4 perfect stamens, and from the two species mentioned in the entire absence of staminodes. The absence of the characteristic hairs around the petals excludes it from *Struthiola*, while the allied genus *Drapetes*, which does not occur in South Africa, differs in having the upper whorl of stamens perfect with the anthers exserted on long filaments.
