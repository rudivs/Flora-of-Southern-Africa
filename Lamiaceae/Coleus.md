### Description

Annual or perennial herbs or shrubs, sometimes succulent (juicy/fleshy), sometimes with a fleshy or tuberous rootstock (thickened underground part of a stem). Leaves opposite, sometimes whorled (arranged in a ring around the stem). Inflorescence (the arrangement of flowers on the plant) thyrsoid (a type of branched inflorescence), strongly condensed to lax (ranging from closely packed to loose), with cymes (a type of flower cluster) that are either directly attached (sessile) or on a stalk (pedunculate), sometimes with long spirally-coiled (cincinnate) branches, 1– many-flowered; bracts (modified leaves that are often associated with a flower or flower cluster) subtending (situated beneath or supporting) cymes usually not lasting beyond the flowering phase, sometimes standing upright forming a hair-like tip (coma) at the top of the flowering stem. Flowers either directly attached (sessile) or on a small stalk (pedicellate), sometimes arranged in a spiral on the inflorescence axis (central stem of the flower cluster). 

Calyx (outermost whorl of the flower, typically green) is funnel-shaped to tubular, straight or curved, often bulging on the lower side (ventrally gibbous), with the stalk (pedicel) attaching off-center at the base of the calyx opposite the rear lip. The calyx can have two lips or can be evenly 5-lobed, and sometimes it can open with a horizontal cut at the base (circumscissile, as in C. coeruleus). The opening (throat) of the calyx is smooth, hairy (pubescent), or has a tuft of hairs (bearded), and can be open or closed by overlapping parts or converging lips. If the calyx has regular lobes, they can be triangle-shaped, lance-shaped, or spine-like. If the calyx has two lips, the rear lip has one lobe and can be larger, the same size, or extending downwards (decurrent); the front lip has 4 lobes of various shapes; side lobes are lance-shaped, triangle-shaped to oblong or rounded, positioned between the rear lobe and middle lobes of the front lip; middle lobes are lance-shaped to triangular, sometimes separated by a gap (sinus) or sometimes joined at the base.

Corolla (petals of the flower, typically colorful) has two lips, with the back lip shorter than the front lip; tube-shaped part is S-shaped (sigmoid) to almost straight, narrow at the base and widening towards the throat, and rarely has a bulging (gibbous) form. The back lip of the corolla has 4 lobes, standing up or pointing up; the front lip is horizontal and hooded (cucullate) to bowl-shaped (concave). Stamens (male reproductive parts) are 4 in number; their supporting stalks (filaments) can be joined or separate, positioned within the front lip or sticking out. The style (female reproductive part) is split into two thin lobes, but sometimes it's not split. Seeds (nutlets) are egg-shaped (ovoid), often flattened from top to bottom (dorso-ventrally).

### Type
Type: illustration of cultivated material in Bot. Rep. 9, t. 594 (1809) holo.; Eritrea, Dekemehare, Colville 47 (K!, epitype, C, photo. of epitype)

### Height
20-30 (-60) cm

### Habit
The plant is a predominantly erect or ascending perennial herb. Its stems may be unbranched or have a few branches. They are quadrangular and somewhat sturdy. The stems feature long multicellular eglandular hairs (hairs without glands) and short glandular hairs (hairs with glands), and they may or may not have red oil globules. In its morphology, the plant can also grow as a bushy, softly semi-succulent woody herb or a soft shrub up to 3 m tall, with stems that are densely woolly tomentose (covered in a dense, wool-like hair).

### Leaves
The leaves are ovate in shape and have a crenulate to serrulate edge (slightly rounded or tooth-like projections). They are thickish in texture and measure between 4-8 x 2-4.5 cm. The leaves are pubescent (covered in fine hairs) on both sides and have red-gland-dots underneath. The petiole (the stalk attaching the leaf blade to the stem) is up to 1.5 cm long and is somewhat winged. In its other form, the leaf blades are semi-succulent, ovate to broadly elliptical, and measure 40-90 x 25-50 mm. They are densely woolly tomentose and the under-surface is copiously gland-dotted. 

### Inflorescences
The plant features verticillasters (a whorl-like arrangement of flowers) that are approximately 8-flowered. These form spike-like racemes (unbranched flower clusters) that are about 10-20 cm long. The inflorescence axis (the main stem of the flower cluster) is glandular villous (covered in long, glandular hairs). In its other form, the inflorescence is a terminal spike-like raceme measuring 200-230 mm long, which becomes lax as it ages. 

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx (the outermost part of the flower, typically green) is about 5 mm during flowering and often dark-colored. It spreads out and becomes deflexed (bent sharply downward) and curved when the plant is fruiting, measuring 8-10 mm. It is densely white-villous (covered in white, long hairs) in the throat and features 10 ribs. The upper lip of the calyx is entire and ovate, while the lower has 4 triangular teeth that are acuminate (tapering to a point) and mucronate (ending in a short sharp point).

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (the inner circle of a flower, usually brightly colored) can be bluish-purple or white and measures up to about 2 cm. It is often red-gland-dotted. The tube of the corolla is deflexed and does not have an annulus (a ring-like structure). The upper lip is short and features 2-4 lobules, while the lower lip is boat-shaped and much narrowed at the base.

### Fruits
The fruit consists of dark brown nutlets (small nuts) that are smooth, ovoid-spherical, and measure approximately 1.5 x 1.5 mm. They do not become mucilaginous (gel-like) when wet.

### Distribution
The plant is native to India and was likely introduced to East Africa at an early stage. It is cultivated in various parts of the world, including southern Africa, where it has become semi-naturalized. In South Africa, it is found in the LP, MP, GP, NW and KZ provinces.

### Ecology
Information about the plant's ecology is not provided.

### Additional notes
The plant exhibits variability in its morphology, with some forms growing as a bushy, softly semi-succulent woody herb or a soft shrub up to 3 m tall. In different forms, the leaves can be larger and the inflorescences can differ in length.

## Coleus bojeri

### Type
Type: Madagascar, Bojer s.n. (P!, holo. W, iso.)

### Height
0.1-2 m

### Habit
Coleus bojeri is an annual or short-lived perennial herb that can sometimes appear fleshy, and can grow 0.1 to 2 meters tall, arising from a taproot. The plant may or may not be aromatic. Stems are erect or ascending, occasionally creeping at the base and rooting adventitiously. The quadrangular stems can be either branched or unbranched, and are sometimes marked with a prominent purple color. They are sparsely covered in hair (pubescent to villose) with retrorse and scattered or dense, longer, non-glandular (eglandular) hairs, along with red sessile glands, and very rarely have glandular hairs.

### Leaves
Leaves of Coleus bojeri are petiolate (having a stalk) and their blades can sometimes be purplish. They are sometimes very thin and are shaped from ovate to rhombic or deltate, measuring 0.8–12 × 2.2–7(–11.5) cm. The leaves have a crenate to serrate (scalloped to toothed) margin, sometimes deeply so, and are sometimes weakly revolute (curled back). The apex of the leaf may be acute to rounded, while the base is cuneate to truncate or auriculate (ear-shaped), but tapering at the petiole. Leaves are pubescent or sparsely so, and with reddish sessile glands. The petiole is 5–65(–110) mm long.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence of Coleus bojeri is usually lax but may be condensed during flowering, with 6 to 30 flowered verticils (whorls) that are 3–45 mm apart. Cymes are sessile (without stalks), or rarely with very short peduncles, and have 3 to 15 flowers with lateral cincinni (coiled arrangements) up to 25–45 mm long. Bracts are erect above, slightly hooded (cucullate), 2–6 mm long, and become deflexed and deciduous, though the lowermost may persist and appear leaf-like. The pedicels are 2–5 mm long.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx of Coleus bojeri is 1–2 mm long and pubescent, with red sessile glands. The fruiting calyx extends to 3–5 mm and is tubular, slightly constricted at the throat, and slightly curved, with the pedicel attached eccentrically behind the posterior lip. The throat is truncate (flat or squared at the end), and the posterior lip is elliptic, curving upwards, and either acute or rounded at the apex, not or shortly extending downward. The lateral lobes are rounded and oblong, while the median lobes of the anterior lip are linear, equal, or just exceeding the posterior lip, and are 2–3 mm long with 0.5 mm long teeth.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla of Coleus bojeri is pale blue to purple, measuring 3–10(–12) mm long, and is pubescent on the lobes, with red sessile glands. The tube is 2–5 mm long, shaped like an "S" (sigmoid), anteriorly swollen (gibbous) at the first bend, and dorsally swollen at the second, with the sigmoid part of the tube either hidden or not. The posterior lip is erect or bent back (reflexed), shorter than the anterior lip, which is 1.5–5(–7) mm long and hood-like (cucullate), enclosing the stamens. The staminal filaments of Coleus bojeri are fused together.

### Fruits
The nutlets of Coleus bojeri are brown and speckled with reddish dots. They are ovoid, 1 mm long, and produce a small amount of sticky substance (mucilage).

### Distribution
In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, KZ provinces.

### Ecology
Coleus bojeri is found in various habitats including grassland, woodland, open rocky areas, forest clearings, and disturbed ground, at elevations ranging from 700 to 2100 meters.

### Additional notes
This treatment of P. autranii, P. dupuisii, and P. bojeri shows substantial differences from that of Codd (1985). There is significant variation within and between P. bojeri, P. dupuisii, and P. rotundifolius regarding underground parts and other characteristics, complicating identification. Detailed examination of specimens and further revision might be necessary to fully understand these species. Specific differences in underground parts, leaf size, corolla length, and fruiting calyces may be noticed in different regions, but no clear discontinuity separates them, thus only one species is recognized. The plant's underground parts are poorly collected and seldom appear on herbarium sheets, making identification challenging. Some specimens show unique features like long peduncles or differing leaf structures, but this does not lead to a clear distinction between species.

## Coleus calycinus

[![Colueus calycinus](https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/269727922/medium.jpg)](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/156011139)

### References

### Type
Type: South Africa, Eastern Cape, between St Johns and Umsikaba rivers, 1837, Drège 3584 (K lectotype, MO, P), lectotypified by Codd (1984).

### Height
0.6–1.5 m

### Habit
Coleus calycinus is a perennial suffrutex (a subshrub that appears like a perennial herb but has a woody base), standing 0.6–1.5 meters tall. It features one or a few stems that arise from a woody rootstock and give off an aromatic scent. The stems are erect, quadrangular (four-sided), simple, and branched in the inflorescence area. The plant is covered in short spreading glandular and eglandular hairs with scattered red sessile (sitting directly on the surface) glands.

### Leaves
The leaves of this species are ascending, sessile (stalkless), and arranged oppositely, though ternate (in groups of three) in other parts of its range. The blade of the leaf measures 30–60 × 15–40 mm and may be ovate, narrowly ovate, or elliptic in shape. The edges are crenate (scalloped), and the leaf has an obtuse (blunt) apex and a cuneate (wedge-shaped) to rounded base. The upper surface of the leaves is pubescent (covered in soft hairs), while the underside is tomentose (densely covered with matted woolly hairs), and there are reddish sessile glands.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is lax and branched, comprising 3–5-flowered cymes that are pedunculate (having a stalk) and dichasial (having two branches) at the first branch, with lateral cincinni (spirally arranged flower clusters) around 5 mm long. The peduncle is 2–4 mm long, and the bract is spreading, 3 mm long, elliptic, and persistent. The pedicel (stalk of an individual flower) measures 2–3 mm in length.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx (the outer whorl of the flower, typically green) is 2 mm long, pubescent (covered in soft hairs), and densely so on the lobes, with red sessile (sitting directly on the surface) glands. When the plant is fruiting, the calyx becomes 7–9 mm long, erect, tubular, and slightly constricted at the throat, curving slightly upwards. The pedicel is attached approximately at the center of the calyx base. It has five equally lobed sections; the lobes are lanceolate (shaped like a lance head) and pubescent on both surfaces, with the posterior not extending downward.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (the inner circle of the flower, typically colorful) is white, measuring 7–8 mm long, and is pubescent on the lobes and tube, with pale sessile glands. The tube is 4 mm long, curved at the base, distally straight, saccate (pouch-like) at the base, and constricting slightly towards the throat. The posterior lip is vertical and approximately equal to the anterior lip, which measures 3–4 mm long and is shallowly cucullate (hooded), horizontal. The staminal filaments (stalks holding the pollen-producing anthers) are free and held within the anterior lip.

### Fruits
The nutlets (small nuts) of Coleus calycinus are pale brown, smooth, minutely speckled, 1.5 mm long, ovoid (egg-shaped), and slightly flattened. They produce a small amount of mucilage (a sticky substance) if scratched.

### Distribution
This species is found in Mozambique and South Africa, ranging from Limpopo to Eastern Cape Provinces. In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, KZ, FS and EC provinces.

### Ecology
Coleus calycinus grows on grassy hillsides among rocks and is found at elevations ranging from 0 to 100 meters.

### Additional notes
The species is considered widespread and of Least Concern for conservation. The inflorescence and corolla morphology of this plant closely align it with Plectranthus rehmannii Gürke from South Africa.

### Type
Type: India, Deccan Peninsula, locality unknown. Herb. Wight in Wall. Cat. 2747B (K lectotype (Herb. Benth.), K-W), lectotypified by Suddee & Paton (2004).

### Height
0.4–2.5 m

### Habit
Perennial succulent herb, aromatic. Stems are rounded-quadrangular below and quadrangular above. They are erect or ascending, more rarely scandent (climbing) or prostrate (lying on the ground), sometimes clump-forming and succulent. The color ranges from pinkish to dark red, and they produce short axillary shoots that fall off to create new plants. The stems are pubescent to tomentose (covered with dense soft hair) with retrorse or spreading eglandular hairs and colorless or yellowish sessile glands.

### Leaves
Leaves are spreading or deflexed (bent sharply downward), succulent, with young shoots in axils, and sessile (attached directly at the base without a stalk). The blade measures 12–60 × 5–22 mm and is elliptic to obovate, crenate (with rounded teeth), serrate (toothed) or dentate (with tooth-like projections), weakly revolute (rolled back), apex obtuse to rounded, base attenuate (gradually tapering), densely pubescent to tomentose, with yellowish sessile glands. The petiole is indistinguishable from the attenuate base.

### Inflorescences
Inflorescence (flower arrangement) becomes lax (loose) in fruit, with 10–40-flowered verticils (whorls) touching or up to 30 apart in fruit; cymes (a type of flower cluster) are sessile (without stalk) and contain 5–20 flowers, with the first branch dichasial producing two lateral cincinni (spiral arrangement of flowers). The bract is 2–4 mm long, ovate to elliptic, erect above forming a small inconspicuous terminal coma, soon deflexed and falling before fruiting, rarely persistent. The pedicel is 2–3 mm long, slightly flattened, straight or slightly curved distally.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx is 1.5 mm long and densely tomentose with white hairs and yellowish or orange sessile glands. The fruiting calyx is 2–3 mm long, shortly tubular, with the pedicel attached eccentrically behind the posterior lip; the throat is truncate (shortened or cut off at the end). The posterior lip is narrowly elliptic, purplish, slightly cucullate (hooded) or flat, horizontal, and not decurrent (extending down the stem). The lobes of the anterior lip are equal, lanceolate (shaped like a lance head) with a deep slit between median lobes.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (whorl of petals) is white, marked blue or violet to violet, 3–5 mm long with scattered hairs and yellowish sessile glands on lobes. The tube is 2–2.5 mm long and sigmoid (S-shaped). The posterior lip is erect, shorter than the anterior, and the anterior lip is 1–2 mm long, shallowly hooded, horizontal. Staminal (related to stamens) filaments are free and shortly exceed the anterior lip.

### Fruits
The nutlets are brown and shiny with reddish dots, 1 mm long, broadly elliptic and flattened, producing lots of mucilage (sticky substance) speckled on the outer surface.

### Distribution
Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Arabian Peninsula, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, GP, KZ provinces.

### Ecology
Found on rock outcrops and dry Acacia–Commiphora scrub; at altitudes between 600–1800 m.

### Additional notes
Widespread and listed as Least Concern for conservation. It is closely related to Plectranthus pseudomarrubioides R.H. Willemse from Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and N Tanzania on account of its free stamens, calyx shape and structure, and habit. It differs by having shorter corollas, more distinctly petiolate (having a leafstalk) leaves, and often a more erect habit.

### Type
Type specimen is from Natal, Karkloof, collected by Rehmann 7383. The plant is an erect or straggling, probably perennial herb.

### Height
0.25-1 m

### Habit
The plant grows in an erect or straggling manner. It is likely a perennial herb, meaning it lives for more than two years. The stems are branched and covered with glandular-pilose hairs, which are long multicellular hairs and also gland-tipped hairs.

### Leaves
The leaves are petiolate, meaning they have a stalk attaching them to the stem. The blade is thin-textured, broadly ovate to ovate-deltoid in shape, and measures 30-100 x 25-80 mm. The leaves are sub-glabrous to thinly pubescent (slightly covered in fine hairs) and have colorless gland-dots on the under-surface. The apex (tip) is acute to abruptly acute, and the base is broadly truncate and shortly attenuates into the petiole. The margin of the leaves is coarsely crenate-dentate, meaning it has large, rounded teeth. The petiole itself is 20-60 mm long.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is either simple or paniculate and ranges from 100-200 mm in length. The flowers are usually arranged in sessile, 3-flowered cymes that form 2-6 flowered verticils, spaced 10-30 mm apart. A cyme is a type of flower cluster, and a verticil is a whorl-like arrangement.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx is 6 mm long during the fruiting stage and is sparsely glandular-puberulous, meaning it's slightly covered in fine, glandular hairs.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla is sky-blue to deep blue in color and measures 8-10 mm in length. It is sparingly pubescent and the tube is deflexed, meaning it bends sharply downward. The tube expands but is not markedly saccate (pouch-like) at the base. The upper lip of the corolla is very short, measuring 1.5-2 mm, while the lower lip is boat-shaped and curved upwards, 4-5 mm long.

### Fruits
Information about the fruits is not provided.

### Distribution
Endemic to South Africa. The known distribution of the plant is somewhat disjunct. It has been recorded from the Stutterheim district in the Cape, the Natal Midlands, and the foothills of the Drakensberg, as well as from the Mariepskop-Woodbush area in the Transvaal. In South Africa, it is found in the LP, KZ and EC provinces.

### Ecology
The plant is often locally common as a ground-layer herb in cool, moist forests.

### Additional notes
The plant is characterized by its bright blue corolla, which widens slightly towards the throat and has a very short upper lip.

### Type
Type: South Africa, plant cultivated at K from material sent by J. Medley Wood from KwaZulu-Natal, 1893 (K lectotype, BOL), lectotypified by Codd (1975).

### Height
0.6-1.2 m

### Habit
Coleus ssculentus is characterized as a perennial herb or suffrutex (a woody plant with perennial stems) with a tuberous-rooted base. The plant has herbaceous erect stems that are sparingly branched. It is usually leafless at the time of flowering and the stems are covered in rather coarse, whitish hairs. The plant grows from a tuberous-rooted base with one or several stems arising annually.

### Leaves
The leaves are fairly thick in texture and are subsessile, meaning they have very short stalks. The blade is oblong-elliptic to oblanceolate in shape and measures 50-80 x 13-25 mm. The leaves are scabrid (rough to touch) and the under-surface has brown gland-dots. The apex of the leaves is obtuse to rounded, and the base is obtuse to cuneate (wedge-shaped). The margins are obscurely denticulate, meaning they have small, tooth-like projections.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescences occupy the upper 0.2-0.6 m of the stem and consist of 2-4 short racemes (unbranched flower clusters) from each node, occasionally branched. The flowers are solitary and located in the axil of each bract, with persistent bracts and pedicels that are 2-5 mm long.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx measures 9-10 mm long when the plant is fruiting and is glandular-hispidulous, meaning it's covered in short, glandular hairs. It has 5 teeth, with the upper tooth being the largest.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla is yellow in color and measures 14-16 mm long. The tube is geniculate, meaning it has a sharp bend, and expands above the middle. The upper lip is 2 mm long, while the lower lip is deeply boat-shaped and measures 7-8 mm long.

### Fruits
Information about the fruits is not provided.

### Distribution
The plant is distributed from Equatorial Africa southwards to Angola, the eastern Transvaal, Swaziland, and coastal Natal. In South Africa it occurs in the MP, KZ provinces.

### Ecology
The plant is commonly found in dry, wooded areas. It is often spread by cultivation because its tubers are edible.

### Additional notes
The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are borne in short pseudo-racemes (false racemes) after the leaves have been shed. It also has thickened, edible roots, making it a popular choice for cultivation.

## Coleus grandidentatus

### Type
The type is located in South Africa, Cape, East Griqualand, Emyembe Mt, and was collected in April 1885. The specimen Tyson 1517 is preserved at the Kew herbarium (K lectotype), and was lecotypified by Codd in 1975.

### Height
Up to 2 m

### Habit
Coleus grandidentatus is characterized as a perennial semi-succulent procumbent herb with trailing or straggly stems. The stems are floccose-tomentose (covered with a soft, woolly mass), reflecting a certain degree of variation in leaf size and marginal teeth. This species tends to resemble other Coleus species, possibly resulting from hybridization.

### Leaves
The leaves of Coleus grandidentatus are petiolate (having a stalk) and semi-succulent, with an ovate to broadly ovate shape. They range in size from 20-70 x 18-75 mm and are usually densely pubescent (covered with soft, downy hairs). The under-surface features red to brownish gland-dots, while the apex is acute, the base is truncate (broadly flat), and the margin is deeply dentate (toothed) with 4-7 pairs of triangular teeth each 3-7 mm long. The petiole (leaf stalk) ranges from 15-45 mm in length.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is terminal (at the tip of the stem), often appearing on short lateral shoots. It is usually simple but may occasionally have 1-2 pairs of branches near the base. The flowers are found in 3-6-flowered sessile (stalkless) cymes (flower clusters), forming 6-12-flowered verticils (whorls). These verticils are spaced 5-10 mm apart.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx (outermost part of the flower) is 4 mm long in fruit and is described as glandular-scabrid (rough to the touch due to glandular projections).

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (collective term for petals) is white, although rarely purple, and finely pubescent (covered in fine, soft hairs) and gland-dotted. It is 7-13 mm long with a tube slightly bent in the middle, expanding to the throat. The lower lip of the corolla is boat-shaped, ranging from 4-8 mm long, and the stamens (male reproductive parts) are free to the base and 5-8 mm long.

### Fruits
Not described in the information provided.

### Distribution
Coleus grandidentatus is found from the Soutpansberg to eastern Transvaal, Swaziland, Natal Midlands, and Eastern Cape, reaching as far as Queenstown. In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, GP, KZ and EC provinces.

### Ecology
This species typically grows in relatively dry, rocky places in open woodland areas.

### Additional notes
Coleus grandidentatus shows significant variation in leaf size and marginal teeth size, and at certain points, it approaches other species within the Coleus genus, hinting at possible hybridization events.

### Type
Type: Yemen, Hadiyah (Hadi) Mts, Forsskål s.n. (C holotype).

### Height
0.2–1.5 m

### Habit
Perennial herb, succulent or slightly so, occasionally with thickened roots, and aromatic. Stems are rounded-quadrangular, procumbent (lying on the ground), scandent (climbing), or weakly ascending, sometimes mat or clump-forming. The stems are branched, purplish above, and older stems may have conspicuous leaf scars. They are villose (covered with soft, shaggy hair) to pubescent with long spreading and retrorse eglandular and usually shorter glandular hairs, usually with scattered red sessile (stemless) glands on the inflorescence axis.

### Leaves
Leaves are spreading, petiolate (having a stalk), slightly succulent, and sometimes with clusters of younger leaves in axils. The blade measures 10–50(60–120) × 10–50(60–110) mm, ovate to triangular, crenate (having rounded teeth) or dentate (toothed) with deltate (triangular) teeth, weakly revolute (rolled back), apex rounded or obtuse, base rarely cordate, truncate, or broadly cuneate (wedge-shaped). The surface is pubescent to tomentose, with pale and sometimes red sessile glands beneath, and petioles are 7–50 mm long.

### Inflorescences
Inflorescence (flower arrangement) is lax with 4–12(20)-flowered verticils (whorls) 10–20 mm apart, bract subtending opposite, sessile, 2–6(10)-flowered cymes (a type of flower cluster). Bract is 1–3 mm long, erect above forming an inconspicuous terminal coma, soon deciduous (shedding) below; pedicel (2)3–6(9) mm long, mostly spreading.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx is 1–2 mm long and pubescent with red sessile glands. The fruiting calyx is 3–6 mm long, tubular, slightly curved, with the pedicel attached eccentrically behind the posterior lip; throat is truncate (cut off at the end). The posterior lip is elliptic, purple, shortly decurrent (extending down the stem), slightly curved upwards; anterior lobes are lanceolate (lance-shaped) with median lobes slightly narrower and longer than the laterals.

### Flowers (corolla)
Corolla (whorl of petals) is blue or purple, 6–13 mm long, glabrous (smooth) or pubescent, with red sessile glands on lobes. The tube is (2)4–6 mm long, shallowly sigmoid (S-shaped), dorsally convex at bend; the posterior lip is shorter than the anterior. Staminal filaments (stalks of stamens) are free.

### Fruits
Nutlets are brown and shiny with reddish dots, 1 mm long, broadly elliptic, and flattened; they produce lots of mucilage (sticky substance) speckled on the outer surface.

### Distribution
Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Egypt to South Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Sri Lanka. In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, GP, NW, KZ and EC provinces.

### Ecology
Found on rocky soil or outcrops, rocky areas in Acacia–Commiphora scrub or deciduous woodland; at altitudes between 800–2100 m.

### Additional notes
Widespread and listed as Least Concern for conservation. There is a general pattern in tropical Africa (excluding South Africa) that material from S Tanzania and the Flora Zambesiaca region often has larger leaves with longer petioles. In East Africa, material from upland Kenya tends to have longer pedicels and larger mature calyces than material from Uganda and coastal areas, but there are no clear discontinuities.

### References
- [Coleus hereroensis Reference](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:77201108-1/general-information)

### Type
The type specimen of Coleus hereroensis is found in Namibia, Hereroland, Kaiser Wilhelmsberg near Okahandja, collected in March 1886 by Marloth (B† holotype, G, M, PRE, SAM). Codd (1985) cited the original holotype as being destroyed in Berlin with a Kew specimen cited as the lectotype. However, no specimen bearing this number exists at Kew.

### Height
0.2-2 m

### Habit
Coleus hereroensis is an annual or short-lived perennial herb or herbaceous shrub with a single stem arising from a fibrous root system. It is slightly aromatic and possesses erect, quadrangular stems that branch above. The stems are pubescent (hairy) with short retrorse (bent or curved backward) eglandular (without glands) and sometimes spreading eglandular or glandular hairs and red sessile (without a stalk) glands.

### Leaves
The leaves are petiolate (with a stalk) and spreading. They are 20–80(100) × 15–55(70) mm in size, ovate or triangular in shape, and sometimes folded along the midrib when dry. They can be crenate (with rounded teeth) to deeply crenate or dentate (with tooth-like projections), with an acute apex and a base that is cuneate (wedge-shaped) to cordate (heart-shaped). The leaves are pubescent to almost glabrous with eglandular (sometimes glandular) hairs and reddish sessile glands.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence of Coleus hereroensis ranges from lax to fairly condensed, with adjacent 15–50-flowered verticils touching distally or spaced 10–25 mm apart. They bear opposite pedunculate (stalked) 7–25-flowered cymes with the first branch dichasial (divided into two parts), producing two lateral cincinni (spiral arrangements) up to 20 mm long. The peduncle is 3–25 mm long, and the bract is inconspicuous, linear, 2–10 mm long, and persistent, sometimes withering by the fruiting stage. The pedicel is 1–3 mm long.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx of the flower is 2 mm long, sometimes purplish above, and pubescent with glandular or eglandular hairs and reddish sessile glands. The fruiting calyx is 5–7 mm long, erect, and parallel to adjacent calyces, tubular, and variably curved with the throat sometimes at right angles to the tube. It is slightly constricted at the throat, and the pedicel is attached eccentrically behind the posterior lip. The lobes of the calyx are ± equal and lanceolate, variably hairy on the inner surface, and sometimes finally reflexed (bent backward).

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla is blue and 9–12 mm long, sparsely pubescent on the lobes, with scattered red sessile glands. The tube is 4–7 mm long and sigmoid (curved in two planes), with the posterior lip shorter than the anterior. The anterior lip is 4–8 mm long and encloses the stamens, or the stamens may be finally exserted (protruding).

### Fruits
The nutlets of Coleus hereroensis are dark brown, shiny, smooth, and 1 mm long, with inconspicuous reddish gland dots. They produce speckled mucilage.

### Distribution
Coleus hereroensis is distributed in Botswana and Zimbabwe, and also found in Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. In South Africa occurs in LP, GP, NW, KZ, EC and WC provinces.

### Ecology
This species grows on rock outcrops, in rocky areas within woodland or grassland, along streamsides or roadsides, and is found at altitudes between 900–1800 meters.

### Additional notes
Coleus hereroensis is classified as a widespread species of Least Concern. The recognition of this species includes some variations in different regions, such as variations in peduncle length, height, and leaf attributes. Coleus aconitiflorus from Angola differs only in having lanceolate leaves and is considered synonymous. Coleus hereroensis differs from P. tenuicaulis in having subequal fruiting calyx teeth, and some details regarding the calyx and inflorescence structure also set it apart from similar species. The recognition of Coleus hereroensis includes consideration of these variations, regarding it as one variable species.

### Type
Type: South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal, Umlazi Valley, near Durban, Drège s.n. (K!, holo. PRE, iso.)

### Height
0.5–2 m

### Habit
Coleus kirkii is a perennial herb that can reach heights between 0.5 to 2 meters. It becomes woody at the base as it matures. The stems arise from a woody rootstock, and they are erect, branching, quadrangular (four-sided), and grooved. The stems become more rounded-quadrangular where they are woodier and are covered in short downward-pointing hairs without glands (eglandular hairs) as well as red sessile glands.

### Leaves
The leaves of this species are arranged oppositely or in whorls of three and are sessile (without stalks). The blades are narrowly elliptic to narrowly ovate (egg-shaped), measuring 3–8 × 0.5–2.5 mm, with serrate (saw-toothed) margins. The serrations vary in depth and frequency and sometimes appear almost hooked at the tips. The leaf apex is acute (sharp), and the base is rounded, almost truncate (cut off). The leaves are also punctate (marked with points) with red and yellow sessile glands and pubescent (covered with soft hairs) with short eglandular hairs, more plentiful on margins and venation beneath. The venation is often raised and reticulate (net-like).

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is dense and forms a narrowly conical shape when in flower, measuring 40–65 × 15–18 mm when in fruit. The bracts that subtend the entire inflorescence are lanceolate (lance-shaped) and measure 6–10 mm long, with acute tips. They are also punctate and pubescent with short eglandular hairs, and they persist through the flowering stage. The bracts subtending single flowers are linear-lanceolate, 4–8 mm long, thick, pubescent, and ciliate (fringed with hairs).

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx of the flower has a tube that is approximately 1 mm long, with an outer surface that has eglandular hairs and scattered red sessile glands around the top of the tube and the base of the lobes. The inner surface has 0.5 mm triangular scales between the lobes. There are 5 lobes, which are narrow and almost equal, with a membranous wing on either side of the midrib that narrows toward the apex, 2–4 mm long. They may have occasional red sessile glands and sometimes short eglandular hairs at the base. The fruiting calyx has a tube 4–5 mm long, which is long and narrow and somewhat ventrally gibbous (swollen on one side), with lobes that are almost straight, 3–5 mm long.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (petals of the flower) is white or pale blue, measuring 9–11 mm long. The tube is pubescent (covered with soft hairs), sometimes sparsely so, very narrow, and parallel-sided for 4–5 mm. It then curves sharply downwards and broadens for 2–3 mm before opening into two lips. The posterior lip (back lip) is shorter than the anterior (front), approximately 2 mm long, with red sessile glands, and pubescent. The anterior lip is 4–6 mm long and 2–4 mm deep, also with red sessile glands and pubescent.

### Fruits
The fruits are small nutlets, approximately 1.5 mm long.

### Distribution
Widely distributed in south-eastern and southern tropical Africa. In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, GP, NW, FS, KZ and EC provinces.

### Ecology
This species is typically found in marsh and swamp grasslands, at elevations ranging from 600 to 2500 meters above sea level.

### Additional notes
Coleus kirkii has a large distribution and exhibits a substantial amount of morphological variation. While there are extreme forms of variation, they can be linked by intermediate specimens, making it unfeasible to recognize any further taxa. The Tanzanian collections match P. uliginosa, which was synonymised by Bruce (1940). There are also variations in leaf shape and margin, and the reticulate venation can either be conspicuous or not. South African P. reticulata can have longer calyx lobes (up to 6 mm) with short eglandular hairs and a corolla up to 18 mm long. The species is considered to be of "Least Concern" for conservation purposes.

### Height
0.5 m

### Habit
The Coleus lasianthus is a succulent mat-forming herb with a stem up to 0.5 m long, which emits an aromatic fragrance. The stems are brittle and succulent, lying flat on the ground (procumbent), quadrangular in shape, and arising from a central main root (taproot). They root at nodes below and are densely covered with various types of hairs including long spreading glandular, eglandular hairs, retrorse hairs, and red sessile glands. Sometimes the spreading hairs are absent.

### Leaves
The leaves are spreading, succulent, and can be either stalked (petiolate) or stalkless (sessile). The blade measures 10–35 × 5–20 mm and can be elliptic, rhombic, or obovate in shape. The leaves are serrated at the edges and slightly rolled back at the margins (weakly revolute). The apex may be pointed (acute) to rounded, and the base narrows (cuneate) to attenuate. The leaves are pubescent, with long glandular and eglandular hairs and red sessile glands, and sometimes with short glandular hairs. The stalk (petiole) can be up to 5 mm long.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is condensed above, with adjacent 6-flowered clusters (verticils) either touching at the flowering stage (anthesis) or slightly separated, up to 10 mm apart when bearing fruit. The bract is succulent, persistent, and erect, but soon spreads and is 10 mm long, broadly elliptic to oblong in shape, and often reddish on the edges. The flower stalk (pedicel) is erect, 3–4 mm long, flattened, slightly winged at the base, and curved at the tip.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx (outer part of the flower) is 3 mm long and covered with hair (pubescent) or shaggy hair (villose) along with red sessile glands. The fruiting calyx is 5 mm long and shortly tubular, with the pedicel attached eccentrically behind the upper lip. The throat is flat at the end (truncate), densely shaggy (villose), with the upper lip shortly extending downward (decurrent), curving upwards, and shaped elliptic or obovate with a pointed tip (mucronate at apex). The lower lip has four lobes, lanceolate in shape, with the median lobes longer than the lateral.

## Coleus leemannii (Rabdosiella leemannii)

[![Coleus leemannii](https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/32274520/medium.jpeg)](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20912526)

### References
- [Link to the source](https://journals.abcjournal.aosis.co.za/index.php/abc/article/view/298/243)

### Type
Type information not provided in the description.

### Height
Up to 2 m tall, usually not exceeding 1.5 m.

### Habit
Rabdosiella leemannii is a phanerophyte (perennial, woody stems or trunks that are typically above ground and visible throughout the year), and exhibits a single or multi-stemmed shrubby nature, displaying a distinct erect habit. The main stem can be up to 50 mm in diameter and shows multiple year rings. The bark is grey to grey-brown and smooth, and young stems are covered with pale brown pubescent (short soft hairs). The species can form perennial shrubs with woody stems, reaching 50 mm in diameter at the base and displaying up to 10 clearly defined year rings. In the absence of fire, it forms single-stemmed shrubs, but plants exposed to fire do resprout, forming multi-stemmed shrubs.

### Leaves
Leaves of R. leemannii are arranged in a decussate pattern (opposite pairs at right angles to the next pair) and are rarely three together (ternate). The leaf blade is ovate to elliptic or trullate (spade-shaped), ranging in size from 59-66 mm by 27-36 mm, with the upper surface pale green and strigose (covered with sharp, stiff hairs), and the lower surface grey and tomentose (covered with densely matted woolly hairs). The leaf margins are crenate to dentate (scalloped or toothed), with 10-15 teeth per side, and the main veins range from 5-8 with reticulate (net-like) venation.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is a terminal thyrse (a type of cluster with a main axis and lateral branches that end in flowers) and is 50-100 mm long. The flowers are arranged in pedunculate dichasia (a branched cluster with two opposite branches), each 20 mm long, with peduncles (stalks) ranging from 1-4 mm and pedicels (secondary stalks) ranging from 3.7-4.9 mm long.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx (outermost part of the flower) of R. leemannii is equally 5-toothed, tubular, ranging from 2.2-4.9 mm long in the flowering stage, extending to 1 x 6 mm in the fruiting stage. It is green, glandular hairy, with five lobes that are tinged purple at the apex. During fruiting, the lobes range from 4.2-5.0 mm long.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (petals of the flower) measures between 7.0-9.4 mm long. The tube portion of the corolla is white-hairy, ranging from 3.7-4.9 x 2.9-3.1 mm, with an upper lobe that is tinged purple-pink on the inside and densely glandular hairy on the outside, measuring 1.4-1.9 mm. The lower lobe is boat-shaped, white on the outside, tinged purple-pink on the inside, and ranges from 3.1-4.3 mm.

### Fruits
The fruit of R. leemannii is a small, brown, rounded nutlet, measuring 0.9 x 0.7 mm.

### Distribution
R. leemannii is endemic to the Soutpansberg and Blouberg Afromontane mist-belt open bushland in South Africa, found above 1,400 meters. Restricted to LP Province.

### Ecology
R. leemannii thrives in Soutpansberg Summit Sourveld and Soutpansberg Mountain Bushveld. Mist precipitation is a vital moisture source in its habitat, especially during drought, and can almost double total precipitation when added to rainfall. In the absence of fire, the species forms single-stemmed shrubs, but it can resprout and form multi-stemmed shrubs if exposed to fire. The species is not associated with grassland, as commonly misstated, but rather with the sedge, Coleochloa setifera. Its sheltered habitat allows for a maximum fire period of five years.

### Additional notes
Rabdosiella leemannii is distinct from R. calycina, differing in habitat, habit, and various vegetative and floral features such as erect nature, woody stems, smaller leaves, and flowers. The species is clearly defined by its specific characteristics and unique environment, including its response to fire, mist precipitation, and association with specific vegetation.

### Type
Type: Malawi, ex Hort. Kew, seeds sent from Mt Zomba by Livingstone (K!, holo.)

### Height
1.5–3 m

### Habit
Coleus livingstonei is a perennial herb, reaching heights of 1.5 to 3 meters. It becomes woody below, indicating that the lower part of the plant turns wood-like with age.

### Leaves
The leaves of this plant are opposite and petiolate, meaning they have a leaf stalk. The leaf blades range from broadly to narrowly ovate, measuring 2.5–13 × 1.5–7.5 cm, with a crenate or crenate-serrate edge. The apex of the leaves is pointed (acuminate), and the base can range from slightly heart-shaped (subcordate) to almost straight (truncate) to wedge-shaped (cuneate), sometimes shortly extending into the petiole. The leaves have red gland-like structures and are covered with short non-glandular hairs, which are more plentiful on the margins and the veins beneath. The petiole (leaf stalk) is 8–50 mm long and has similar pubescence and red glands.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence of Coleus livingstonei is dense, forming a conical shape when in flower, and measures 55–140 × 20–40 mm in fruit. The bracts (leaf-like structures) subtending the entire inflorescence are ovate, 15–25 mm long, acute to pointed, enclosing the buds then becoming deflexed in flower, and persist through the flowering stage. The bracts subtending single flowers are lanceolate to almost ovate, 4–15 mm long, conspicuous, covered with hairs, and fringed with fine hairs (ciliate).

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx of the flower has non-glandular hairs and scattered red gland-like structures. The tube is approximately 1 mm long at anthesis (flowering), with small 0.5 mm triangular scales present on the inner surface between the calyx lobes, which also have non-glandular hairs. The lobes are thin, nearly equal, and 5–6 mm long. The fruiting calyx has a 3.5–4 mm long tube, with a swollen (gibbous) ventral side, and the lobes are semi-upright or fully upright, lengthening to 8–11 mm.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla of Coleus livingstonei is blue to purple, measuring 12–20 mm long. The tube has red gland-like structures and is very narrow and parallel-sided for 5–9 mm, then curves sharply downwards and broadens for 3–6 mm before opening into two lips. The posterior lip is shorter than the anterior one, 2–5 mm long, with non-glandular hairs and red glands. The anterior lip is 5–10 mm long, 3–5 mm deep, with scattered non-glandular hairs and red glands on the front.

### Fruits
The fruits of this plant are small nutlets, measuring 1–1.5 mm long.

### Distribution
Distributed in the following regions: K 4 (cultivated); T 2–5; Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Found in upland grassland and wooded grassland with Brachystegia and Protea, at altitudes of 1500–2700 meters. In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, GP, KZ and WC provinces.

### Ecology
Coleus livingstonei inhabits upland grassland and wooded grassland areas, often associated with Brachystegia and Protea trees. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1500 to 2700 meters.

### Additional notes
Coleus livingstonei is cultivated in various places, including Tanzania's Lyamungo Experimental Station and Nairobi gardens. It is considered least concern for conservation and is widely distributed in southern tropical Africa. Recognizable by its ovate, distinctly petiolate leaves, robust inflorescence with conspicuous bracts, and a deeply boat-shaped anterior corolla lip, the plant is rather common in the eastern Flora Zambesiaca area but less so in East Africa. There are variations in leaf and inflorescence size in different collections, and the plant is associated with other species in the same genus.

### Type
Information regarding the type specimen of Coleus madagascariensis is not provided in the description.

### Height
Up to 1 m

### Habit
Coleus madagascariensis is a sprawling, shortly hairy perennial herb that may often be semi-succulent. Its stems are procumbent (lying flat but with the tips ascending) and can reach up to 1 m in length or be decumbent (lying on the ground with the end ascending) to erect, measuring 0.3-0.45 m long. The stems may vary in hairiness, from sparingly to densely tomentose (covered with matted, woolly hairs), often mixed with longer hairs and glandular hairs.

### Leaves
The leaves of Coleus madagascariensis are leathery and petiolate (having a stalk) and the blade is slightly succulent. When dried, the leaves can have a texture ranging from thin to thickish. The shape of the leaf blade is ovate (egg-shaped) to subrotund (almost round), with measurements of 15-30(-45) x 10-25 mm. The upper surface is strigose (covered with parallel, straight, and appressed hairs), and the under-surface is medium to densely tomentose (covered with woolly hairs), often accompanied by reddish to brown gland-dots. The apex of the leaf is obtuse (rounded) to rounded, the base is truncate (flat) to cuneate (wedge-shaped), and the margin is obscurely crenate (scalloped) to crenate-dentate (with scalloped and toothed edges). The petiole (leaf stalk) is 5-35 mm long.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is terminal to the main stem and on side branches. It is usually simple but sometimes has 1-2 pairs of branches near the base. The racemes (unbranched clusters of flowers) are 90-250 mm long, with the flowers in 3-8-flowered cymes (clusters), forming 6-16-flowered verticils (whorls) spaced 5-20 mm apart. The bracts (leaf-like structures) are 3 mm long and early deciduous (falling off).

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx (collective term for sepals) of the flowers is 4-5 mm long at the fruiting stage and gibbous (swollen) at the base. It is glandular-scabrid (rough, with glands) and gland-dotted, with a shape similar to that found in P. dinteri. The calyx becomes swollen below when the fruit develops.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (collective term for petals) is white or mauve to purple in color, and often reddish gland-dotted on the lips, ranging from 5-18 mm long. The tube is bent about the middle, and the lower lip is boat-shaped, being longer than the tube. The stamens (male reproductive parts) are free at the base and about as long as the lower corolla lip.

Up to 0.4 m

### Habit
Coleus mutabilis is a perennial aromatic semi-succulent herb. It features slender stems that are procumbent to hanging from rock ledges. The stems, which can reach up to 40 cm in length, are sparingly branched and covered with a combination of short tomentose (soft, matted hair) to villous-tomentose, often with very long multi-cellular hairs intermingled with short hairs, especially at the nodes.

### Leaves
The leaves of this species are softly semi-succulent and dry fairly thin in texture. The petiole (leaf stalk) is 1.4-3 cm long and shortly pubescent to villous (covered with soft, shaggy hair). The blade is broadly ovate to subrotund (almost round), 1.5-5 cm long and equally broad. The leaves are sparsely to densely strigose (covered with straight, parallel, appressed hairs) above and sparsely strigose on the nerves below to densely woolly tomentose, sometimes with reddish or yellowish sessile gland-dots. The apex is obtuse to rounded, the base is truncate to cordate (heart-shaped), and the margin is deeply scalloped with 3-5 pairs of large rounded teeth.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence is terminal and usually simple but occasionally with a pair of branches near the base. It ranges from 10-25 cm in length, with a rhachis (main axis) that is minutely shortly glandular-hispidulous (covered with tiny bristly hairs). The bracts are subrotund (almost round) and 1.5-2 mm long, shedding early, before the flowering stage.

### Flowers (calyx)
The flowers of Coleus mutabilis are found in sessile (stalkless), 3-6-flowered cymes, forming 6-12-flowered verticillasters (whorls), with verticillasters 1-2 cm apart. The pedicels (stalks supporting the flowers) are 2-3 mm long and glandular-puberulous (covered with minute glandular hairs). The calyx is 2 mm long at flowering, enlarging to 4 mm long in fruit, with a distinctly gibbous (bulging) base. It may be glandular-scabrid (rough) with yellowish or red gland-dots or sometimes without gland-dots.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla (collective term for petals) is blue, purple-blue, or lilac and ranges from 8-12 mm long. It is pubescent (covered with soft hairs) and may have colored gland-dots on the upper and lower lips. The tube is 4-6 mm long and expands from 2 mm deep at the base to 3 mm deep at the throat, bending distinctly below the middle. The upper lip is erect to strongly bent back, 3 mm long, deeply emarginate (notched) at the apex, and has 2 lateral ear-like lobes. The lower lip is boat-shaped, horizontal or slightly upcurved, and 4-5 mm long. The stamens (male reproductive parts) are free at the base, curved, and either enclosed in the lower lip or slightly exserted, 4-6 mm long.

### Fruits
Information regarding the fruits of Coleus mutabilis is not provided in the description.

### Distribution
Endemic to South Africa, occurring in the LP and MP provinces. Coleus mutabilis is found mainly on the Blouberg and Soutpansberg in northern Transvaal but also extends southwards to the Pretoria District.

### Ecology
This species grows on rocky hillsides, either in the shade of the forest or in exposed places. It can be found in rock crevices or hanging from rock ledges.

### Type
Type: South Africa, Mpumalanga, Rimero Creek near Baberton, 1890, Galpin 968 (K holotype, BOL, GRA, NH).

### Height
0.3-0.6 m

### Habit
Coleus neochilus is an annual or perennial succulent herb, standing 0.3–0.6 meters tall. It arises from a fibrous root system and emits a pleasant aroma. The stems of this plant are erect, ascending or decumbent, quadrangular, and arise from a tap root. They are sparsely branched and covered with long, spreading glandular and eglandular hairs and red sessile glands. The stems become noticeably viscid with shorter glandular or eglandular hairs on the inflorescence axis.

### Leaves
The leaves of Coleus neochilus are somewhat fleshy and spreading, usually petiolate (having a stalk called a petiole). The blade measures 15–80 × 10–30 mm, and is obovate or elliptic in shape. It is crenate to serrate (having rounded or sharp teeth) and weakly revolute (curled or rolled) at the edges. The apex is acute, obtuse, or rounded, while the base attenuates and the leaf is covered in red sessile glands. The petiole, when present, is 0–25 mm long.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence of Coleus neochilus is fairly lax with strictly 6-flowered verticils (whorls), approximately 10 mm apart in fruit. It consists of opposite sessile 3-flowered cymes. The bract is green, marked purplish, and erect above, forming a conspicuous terminal coma, and is soon deciduous. The pedicel is 3 mm long, erect, and strongly flattened, with a curve at the distal end.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx of the flower measures 3–5 mm long, is pubescent, and has red and pale sessile glands. During fruiting, the calyx extends to 4–7 mm long, becoming shortly tubular. The posterior lip of the calyx is ovate and curves upward, while the anterior lip is 4-lobed with lanceolate lobes. The median lobe is slightly longer.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla is blue or purple and ranges from 11–20 mm long, adorned with scattered hairs and red sessile glands on the lobes. The tube is 6–10 mm long, sigmoid or shallowly so (S-shaped). The posterior lip is much shorter than the anterior one, and the anterior lip measures 5–11 mm long, horizontal, and cucullate (hood-shaped), partially enclosing the stamens.

### Fruits
The fruit of Coleus neochilus consists of dark brown nutlets that are smooth and have dark dots. Each nutlet is 1 mm long, broadly ovate, and flattened. When wet, the nutlets produce a dotted mucilage.

### Distribution
This species is found in Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique, and it is also native to Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa. In South Africa occurs in LP, MP, GP, NW, FS, KZ, EC, WC and NC provinces.

### Ecology
Coleus neochilus commonly grows in rocky places within woodland or grassland areas, at elevations ranging from 600 to 1600 meters.

### Additional notes
The species is widespread and listed as Least Concern in terms of conservation. The majority of material referred to by Codd (1985) is Plectranthus neochilus rather than P. pentheri, found in Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and W Zimbabwe. Both species are illustrated in van Jaarsveld, Southern African Plectranthus (2006).

### Height
0.4-1(2) m

### Habit
This perennial succulent herb ranges in height from 0.4 to 1 meter, sometimes even reaching up to 2 meters. The plant has an aromatic quality. Its stems are rounded-quadrangular at the base and become more quadrangular towards the top. The stems are ascending and sometimes form clumps. They are succulent and covered in puberulent (downy) antrorse (directed upward) hairs and red sessile glands.

### Leaves
The leaves are spreading and succulent, often with young shoots in their axils. They are sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The blade measures 25–50 x 8–25 mm and is obovate in shape. The upper half of the leaf is irregularly toothed, and the edges are weakly revolute (curled back). The apex is obtuse to rounded, and the base is attenuate (narrowing). The leaves are sparsely pubescent and have red sessile glands.

### Inflorescences
The inflorescence becomes lax in the fruiting stage, consisting of 20–40-flowered verticils spaced 20 mm apart. Each cyme (flower cluster) is sessile and has 10–20 flowers. The first branch is dichasial (forked) with two lateral cincinni (curved flower clusters) that are up to 5 mm long. The bract is about 5 mm long when the plant is fruiting and is elliptic in shape. It is erect above, forming a small, inconspicuous terminal coma (cluster of bracts), but it soon falls off. The pedicel (stalk of the flower) is 1 mm long.

### Flowers (calyx)
The calyx is 2 mm long and is pubescent with white hairs and red sessile glands. When the plant is fruiting, the calyx becomes 4 mm long, tubular in shape, and bends at right angles. The throat points upwards, and the pedicel is attached at the center of the calyx base. The posterior lip is narrowly elliptic, while the lobes of the anterior lip are equal and lanceolate in shape.

### Flowers (corolla)
The corolla is purple and measures 7–10 mm long. It is pubescent and has red sessile glands on the lobes. The tube is 4–5 mm long and is sigmoid (S-shaped). The posterior lip is shorter than the anterior lip, which is 3–5 mm long, shallowly cucullate (hood-shaped), and horizontal. The staminal filaments are free and slightly exceed the anterior lip.

### Fruits
The fruits are brown, shiny nutlets with reddish gland dots. They are 1 mm long and broadly elliptic. They are flattened and produce a lot of mucilage speckled on the outer surface.

### Distribution
The plant is found in Mozambique and extends south to the Eastern Cape in South Africa. In South Africa recorded in LP, MP, NW, KZ, EC and WC provinces.
